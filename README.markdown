afterimage.vim
==============

Edit ICO, PNG, and GIF icons.  No really.  They're converted with
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to XPM, a plain text image
format with beautiful syntax highlighting in GUI versions of Vim.  Here,
it's easier just to show you:

And yes, I did say edit.  Obviously you're not going to be uninstalling
Photoshop anytime soon, but for stupid simple tweaks, it gets the job
done.

Oh, and it can also handle PDFs (with
[pdftk](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)),
Word Documents (read-only, with [Antiword](http://www.winfield.demon.nl/)),
and Mac OS X plist files.

If you are more scientifically inclined it also lets you edit
[NetCDF](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/netcdf) files in their
CDL form.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-afterimage.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help afterimage`.
